# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a growing threat in the digital
economy, demanding smart detection systems. This
project uses unsupervised learning to identify fraudulent
transactions without relying on labeled data, making it
effective in detecting evolving fraud patterns in real-
world scenarios. We use a real-world credit card
transaction dataset containing both normal and
fraudulent entries. Techniques like Isolation Forest and
Autoencoders are applied to detect anomalies based on
transaction behavior.
